# Me-API

This is an API created for the course jsramverk at BTH.
Its purpose is to enable creating, updating and saving documents in a MongoDB database coming from an editor that I am currently working on.

# Installation
1. First download the package from GitHub.
2. Run "npm install" to install all dependencies from package.json and to get /node_modules.
3. Create db/config.json and put in the username and password for your own database.
4. Run "npm start".

# Routes
Routes can be found in /routes. In documents.js, where GET, POST and PUT routes are specified for handling the documents from the editor.
